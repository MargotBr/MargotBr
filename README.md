### Hi! _(in general, it is rather Kikoo for my friends, so Kikoo everyone!)_  👋

#### What am I doing here?

That's right. What am I doing here? 🤔 

I was not really predestined to spend my days coding. There was a time when I was taking food engineering classes 🍲. I learned a lot of stuff: nutrition, food engineering, microbiology, oenology (cheers! 🍇🍷), but also super cool statistics stuff. Models, factor analysis, experimental designs became my daily routine 📈. And R came into my life. During my PhD thesis _- in statistics applied to sensory sciences and food industry -_ I was able to produce my first R package 📦. And tadaaaaa 🎉 it was a revelation. I wanted to code, code, and code again 💻. Now, I am an happy R trainer & R consultant at [@ThinkR-open](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/). 

#### What am I working on?

Here are the projects I am working on or have worked on lately:

- 📦 💻 [`{wedding}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/wedding), a R `{golem}`-style package that launches a `{shiny}` app to plan your wedding _(in this case I created it to plan mine, but the application is generalizable to all people wishing to marry)_ <br />
➡️ A demo is available here : http://connect.thinkr.fr/wedding/ <br />
Login to access the app: _welcome_ <br />
Password to access the app: _bigday_ <br />
Password to access the tab dedicated to brides/grooms: _onlyforbride_

- 🎨 📊 [`plotellaneous`](https://github.com/MargotBr/plotellaneous), a repo where I put my miscellaneous dataviz experiments

- 📦 [`{agreeclust}`](https://github.com/MargotBr/agreeclust), a R package that considers a latent class regression modeling framework for highlighting the structure of disagreement among panels of raters involved in an inquiry

#### What do I like to do?
 
- Spending hours turning `{ggplot2}` upside down to come up with nice and impactful dataviz 📊
- Taking care of my children and my chickens 🐣🐥
- Eating 🍽️
- Refinishing old furniture, embroidery and knitting 🔨🧶
